- First project is in arduino IDE that detects the light being exposed, and when it reaches 600 turns off the led light
- Second one is in my esp32, it detects motion and turns on light when motion is detected
- Third is the previous 2 together
- Forth detects motion and ligh. Keeps the light on until the light and downed to a certain level
- Wifi server is connecting esp32 to a wifi network and turning on and off the actuator
